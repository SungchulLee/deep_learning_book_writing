THE COMPLETE PICTURE: FROM BAYESIAN INFERENCE TO DIFFUSION
==========================================================

Let's trace the full conceptual journey:

1. BAYESIAN INFERENCE (Module 01_Bayesian_Inference):
   -----------------------------------------------------
   Problem: p(θ|D) = p(D|θ)p(θ) / p(D)
   Challenge: Can't compute p(D) = ∫ p(D|θ)p(θ) dθ
   
   Solution needed: Sample from unnormalized distributions!

2. SCORE FUNCTIONS (Module 01):
   -----------------------------
   Key insight: s(x) = ∇_x log p(x)
   
   Properties:
   ✓ Points toward high probability
   ✓ NO normalization needed!
   ✓ Zero at modes
   
   But how do we compute it from data alone?

3. SCORE MATCHING (Module 02):
   ----------------------------
   Learn s_θ(x) ≈ ∇_x log p_data(x) from samples
   
   Key technique: Denoising Score Matching (DSM)
   - Add noise: x̃ = x + σε
   - Learn to predict: s_θ(x̃) ≈ -ε/σ
   
   Connection: Denoising IS Bayesian inference!
   p(x|x̃) posterior → score tells us how to denoise

4. LANGEVIN DYNAMICS (Module 03):
   -------------------------------
   Use learned scores to sample:
   x_{t+1} = x_t + ε s_θ(x_t) + √(2ε) z_t
   
   Converges to p_data(x)!
   Foundation of all diffusion sampling

5. MULTI-SCALE SCORES (Module 07):
   --------------------------------
   Problem: Single σ doesn't work everywhere
   Solution: Learn s_θ(x, σ_i) for multiple noise levels
   
   This becomes the TIME DIMENSION in diffusion!

6. CONTINUOUS FORMULATION (Module 08):
   ------------------------------------
   SDEs make everything continuous:
   - Forward: dx = f(x,t)dt + g(t)dw
   - Reverse: dx = [f - g²∇log p_t]dt + g dw̄
   
   Unified framework for all variants!

7. IMAGE GENERATION (Module 09):
   -----------------------------
   U-Net architecture for images
   Training = DSM at multiple times
   Sampling = Reverse diffusion
   
   SOTA generative models!

8. DIFFUSION MODELS (This module):
   --------------------------------
   Everything unified!

COMPLETE EQUIVALENCES:
====================

SCORE-BASED VIEW              ↔  DIFFUSION VIEW
-----------------                ----------------
Score function s(x,t)         ↔  Noise prediction ε_θ(x,t)
                                 Relation: s(x,t) = -ε/√(1-ᾱ_t)

Denoising score matching      ↔  Noise prediction loss
                                 Both: ||ε - ε_θ||²

Langevin dynamics             ↔  Reverse diffusion
                                 Same sampling procedure!

Annealed Langevin            ↔  Multi-step denoising
                                 Gradually remove noise

VE-SDE                       ↔  Noise-conditional model
VP-SDE                       ↔  DDPM formulation

Probability flow ODE         ↔  DDIM sampling
                                 Deterministic generation

THREE EQUIVALENT FORMULATIONS:
------------------------------

1. SCORE-BASED:
   - Learn score s_θ(x,t) = ∇log p_t(x)
   - Sample via Langevin dynamics
   - Annealed across noise levels

2. DIFFUSION-BASED:
   - Forward: Add noise gradually
   - Reverse: Denoise gradually
   - Learn noise prediction ε_θ(x,t)

3. SDE-BASED:
   - Forward SDE: dx = f dt + g dw
   - Reverse SDE: dx = [f - g²∇log p_t]dt + g dw̄
   - Continuous-time formulation

ALL THREE ARE EQUIVALENT!

KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
-----------------
s(x,t) = -ε_θ(x,t) / √(1-ᾱ_t)         (score ↔ noise)
DSM = Noise prediction loss            (training)
Langevin = Reverse diffusion           (sampling)
Multi-scale = Time conditioning        (architecture)

CENTRAL INSIGHT:
---------------
Denoising = Bayesian posterior inference
Learning to denoise = Learning scores
Iterative denoising = Sampling via scores

This connects:
- Classical statistics (Bayes)
- Sampling theory (Langevin)
- Deep learning (neural networks)
- Stochastic processes (SDEs)
- Modern generative models (diffusion)

Beautiful unification! 🎯
